Columns and Their Descriptions:

Depth (object): Describes the soil sampling depth (e.g., "0-20 cm").
POINTID (float64): Unique identifier for the sampling point.
pH_CaCl₂ (float64): Soil pH measured using a CaCl₂ solution.
pH_H₂O (float64): Soil pH measured in water.
EC (float64): Electrical conductivity of the soil.
OC (float64): Organic carbon content in the soil.
CaCO₃ (float64): Calcium carbonate content in the soil.
P (float64): Phosphorus content in the soil.
N (float64): Nitrogen content in the soil.
K (float64): Potassium content in the soil.
OC (20–30 cm) (float64): Organic carbon content measured in 20–30 cm depth samples.
CaCO₃ (20–30 cm) (float64): Calcium carbonate content measured in 20–30 cm depth samples.
Ox_Al (float64): Oxalate extractable aluminum.
Ox_Fe (float64): Oxalate extractable iron.
NUTS_0 (object): Nomenclature of Territorial Units for Statistics (NUTS) Level 0 (Country code).
NUTS_1 (object): NUTS Level 1 code (regions within countries).
NUTS_2 (object): NUTS Level 2 code (sub-regions).
NUTS_3 (object): NUTS Level 3 code (local administrative units).
TH_LAT (float64): Theoretical latitude of the sampling point.
TH_LONG (float64): Theoretical longitude of the sampling point.
SURVEY_DATE (object): Date when the sample was collected.
Elev (float64): Elevation of the sampling point.
LC (object): Land cover code.
LU (object): Land use code.
LC₀_Desc (object): Description of land cover at Level 0.
LC₁_Desc (object): Description of land cover at Level 1.
LU₁_Desc (object): Description of land use at Level 1.

Observations:
Several columns have missing values (e.g., CaCO₃, Ox_Al, Ox_Fe).
Some columns contain categorical data (e.g., Depth, NUTS codes, LC, and LU).
Columns like OC and CaCO₃ are stored as objects but might need conversion to numeric after handling < LOD (less than limit of detection) values.
